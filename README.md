- there are 3 types of variable present over the javascript.
1. let: 
    - let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
    - Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
    - let is block scope code, so we have been using let for most cases.
2. var:
    - var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
    - var is used in oldest browser, so nowadays we don't use var most of the cases.
3. const:
    - const is a type of variable where we can't change our data furthur.
    - const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc.
